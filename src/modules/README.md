# Modules

All modules are installed on app initialization.
During installation of the module you have access to the `KnownSDK` property.

Check the [example](./example-module.ts) for more information.

You can safely delete this directory if you don't need it.
If you do, also make sure to remove the auto-import resolver from `vite.config.ts`.
